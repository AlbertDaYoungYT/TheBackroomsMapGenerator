# TheBackroomsMapGenerator
The script runs on Blender 3 and only needs 4 easy steps to set up
1. First open Blender and head to the _Script_ section
2. Then create a new script and paste the code from the main.py file
3. After that go to the _Shaders_ tab and create 3 shaders, called _Wall_, _Floor_ and _Light_. You can set the shaders to what ever you want, remember to set _Light_'s Shader Emission to atleast 5 or more
4. Then go back to _Script_ and run the script. It may look like it froze but its because its generating. You can check the console and see where it is in its cycle
